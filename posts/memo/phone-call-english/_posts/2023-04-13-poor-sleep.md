### i don't attend class yester day 

I'm sorry I lost contact with you yesterday. 

As I know, If I don't tell you three hours in advance it cannot be postponed. I don't know if it's okay.


### Poor Sleep

There are times when I'm absent-minded.

I remember hearing that the group that takes a nap has worse heart health.

Do you find it easy to fall asleep.

I didn't hear much about going to bed early.


"It takes one hour to walk there."


### Ban additives

I think the best option is for people to find more healthy food on their own. Because If people want healthier food, then marketing teams in food companies must try to make their food healthy. But as long as people do not want healthy food then restriction may be helpful for the nation. But it takes more cost and not perfect.
