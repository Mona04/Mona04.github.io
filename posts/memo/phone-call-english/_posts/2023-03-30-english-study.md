## 목이 점점 건조해지고 목이 가버린다

I seem to have a sore throat today. I had _a hoarse throat_ and some _itchiness_ in my throat, which made me do _clearing of a throat_. It was okay in the morning, but it got worse in the afternoon. The harder it was for me to speak, as the time of calling or speaking increased.


You always ask me how I was today. I think I will have a habit of reflecting on my day before class starts because of that.

Reflecting on myself is a good habit and I appreciate it.
